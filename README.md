# Spotify Data Analysis

If you're like me, the day of the year that Spotify releases its users' "Year in Review Wrapped" is like Christmas. I open my playlist as soon as it comes, then rush to my phone to see what my friends got. Each 'Wrapped' I learn something invaluable that I couldn't have otherwise hoped to divine. This year, for example, I discovered that I listened to an absurd amount of surf rock for someone who lives three hours from the nearest a beach. Going back in the archives, I learned that in 2015 I ran Bill Withers' Use Me into the ground on repeat (Evidently I did use you, Bill, I did). Records show that in 2016 I first discovered Vulfpeck and an affinity for cooking to Electro Swing music. Then, in 2017, I found out that Aly & Aj had somehow mysteriously, and with totally no involvement of my own, 'snuck' into my top songs. This year Spotify released it's "Decade in Review" feature. As soon as it dropped, my college roommates and I immediately set to combing through ten years of streaming data in order to solve an age-old debate as to who had been listening to Lake Street Dive the longest - and band we each laid finder's claims over.

Whatever the discovery, Spotify's features and analytics have always made music more meaningful. Recently I was excited to learn that Kaggle users had provided access to Spotify data sets in order increase the storytelling of trends in music streaming. Seeking to do just that, the R code in this repository provides analytics on another great 'year-end' feature that Spotify releases, the Global Top 50 playlist.

The following techniques are applied to extract insights on Spotify's top songs in 2019:

I) Data Cleaning
II) Exploratory Data Analysis
III) Statistical Testing and Regression Analysis
IV) Modeling
