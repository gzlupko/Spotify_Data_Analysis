# Spotify Data Analysis

If you're like me, the day of the year that Spotify releases its "Year in Review" Wrapped is like Christmas. I open my playlist as soon as it comes, then rush to my phone to see what my friends got. Each 'Wrapped' I learn something invaluable that I couldn't have otherwise hoped to divine. This year, for example, I discovered that I listened to an absurd amount of surf rock for someone who lives three hours from the nearest a beach. Going back in the archives, I learned that in 2015 I ran Bill Withers' Use Me into the ground on repeat (Evidently I did, Bill, I did use you). Records show that in 2016 I first discovered Vulfpeck and an affinity for cooking to Electro Swing music. Then, in 2017, I found out that Aly & Aj had somehow mysteriously, and with totally no involvement of my own, 'snuck' into my top songs. This year, Spotify released it's "Decade in Review". My college roommates and I traded notes to solve an age old debate as to who had been listening to Lake Street Dive the longest - and band we each lay finders claim to.

Whatever the discovery, Spotify's features and analytics have always made music more meaningful. Recently I was excited to learn that the Kaggle users had provided access to Spotify data sets to allow the community to join in on the storytelling. Below is an R notebook that provides analytics to another great 'year-end' feature that Spotify offers, the Global Top 50 playlist.

The following techniques are applied to extract insights on Spotify listener preferences from 2019:

I) Data Cleaning
