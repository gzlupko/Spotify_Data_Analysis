# Spotify Data Analysis

In this repo, I performed data cleaning, visualization, and statistical testing in R on Spotifyâ€™s Global Top 50 songs. I also implemented multiple regression to identify multivariate predictors of song popularity. Altogether, the following data science techniques were applied to extract insights on Spotify's top songs in 2019:

I) Data Cleaning

II) Exploratory Data Analysis

III) Statistical Testing and Regression Analysis

IV) Modeling
